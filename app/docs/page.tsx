      <p className="text-sm">
        Invariance is a CLI-first tool that closes the loop between <span className="font-bold">physics-based simulation</span> and <span className="font-bold">real-world measurements</span>.
        It takes a forward physical model, compares it against sensor data, and automatically infers the physical parameters that best explain reality.
      </p>

      <h3>What does Invariance solve?</h3>
      <p>
        A balanced model that provides excellent results with faster response times. Great for
        everyday coding tasks.
